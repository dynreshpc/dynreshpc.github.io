# DynResHPC FAQ

## What is DynResHPC?

IXPUG is a community-driven organization that fosters technical collaboration around tuning for Intel® architecture.
IXPUG stands for Intel eXtreme Performance Users Group.

## How did it get started?

The original vision for IXPUG was that “exceptional success” for the Xeon Phi program requires more than a 1-way communication between Intel and HPC center and application scientists; it involves building a community that develops and shares tribal knowledge on how to transform, parallelize, and optimize code to make the most of Xeon Phi.
Over a period of years, Intel and the HPC community have worked together to create and share technical collateral, training, workshops to share proof points and challenges, and to forge a way forward together.
In 2014, the Texas Advanced Computing Center hosted a highly successful IXPUG meeting and the excitement and enthusiasm from that meeting have carried over to a number of ensuing events.
In January of 2018, we changed our name to Intel eXtreme Performance Users Group.

## How does IXPUG relate to other ‘code modernization efforts?’
IXPUG is one of many ways of supporting the broader community’s code modernization efforts. Those efforts stem from Intel, application readiness efforts at the U.S. Department of Energy national labs, and numerous similar efforts in academia and at HPC centers world-wide.

## Who is part of IXPUG?
Anyone interested in achieving performance on codes running on the Intel Xeon Phi is welcome to be part of IXPUG. IXPUG's focus is on High Performance Computing applications in science and engineer, but it is not limited to those ares.
IXPUG is governed and led by an leadership board and steering committee. IXPUG also has organizational members, who are committed to providing resources to help support IXPUG (staff time, hosting meetings, etc.)
Participants in IXPUG primarily come from industry, academia, national labs and institutes, and HPC centers from around the world.
Intel contributes heavily to IXPUG through participation from its technical staff and Intel also helps defray costs associated with 

## IXPUG activities.
If you would like to participate, please see the "Join IXPUG" link on the IXPUG web site (http://ixpug.org/).

## What does IXPUG do?
IXPUG brings together experts and practitioners as a community, in events at major HPC-related conferences, standalone workshops, active technical working groups, and shares learnings through ixpug.org and other related sites.

## What events does IXPUG hold?
See our Events page for a list of upcoming and past events. Please contact us if you would be interested in holding an IXPUG event in your area.
